# Groebner-Basis-for-Linear-Network-Coding-in-Sage
See the results on https://itf.github.io/2018/02/08/Groebner-Basis/, or download the sage notebook.

This shows that one can efficiently test the solvability of linear networks by calculating the Groebner Basis of the ideal of the linear network using sage and libsingular.
